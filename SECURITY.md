# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please email [gbellamy@umd.edu](mailto:gbellamy@umd.edu) or open a
private security advisory on GitHub:
<https://github.com/GraysonBellamy/watlowlib/security/advisories/new>.

Do **not** file public issues for security reports.

## Scope

`watlowlib` drives physical equipment over serial. Please report:

- Code paths that send `PERSISTENT` or `DANGEROUS` commands without
  `confirm=True`.
- Any path that logs credentials, DSNs, or secrets
  (`PostgresConfig.password` in particular is a non-logging field).
- SQL-injection surfaces in `PostgresSink`.
- Deserialisation of untrusted input in fixture loaders or registry
  JSON files.
- Protocol-mode switches, baud-rate changes, or address writes that
  run as a side effect of `open_device(...)` — these should only be
  reachable via `configure_protocol(..., confirm=True)`,
  `set_baud_rate(..., confirm=True)`, or the `watlowlib.maintenance`
  module.
