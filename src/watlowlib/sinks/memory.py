r"""In-memory sink — collects :class:`Sample`\ s in a list for tests.

The one bit of value over "write your own list" is that
:class:`InMemorySink` satisfies the :class:`SampleSink` Protocol, so
acquisition tests can run the same ``pipe()`` call path a production
sink uses and then inspect the captured samples after the fact.
