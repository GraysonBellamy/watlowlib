"""Shared first-batch schema-lock for tabular sinks.

Every tabular sink in the tree (SQLite, Parquet, Postgres, and CSV)
shares the same schema-evolution policy:

1. **First batch wins.** The column set and order are locked from the
   first :meth:`write_many` call. For schema-less sinks this is just
   bookkeeping; for schema-ful sinks (Parquet schema, Postgres table,
   SQLite CREATE TABLE) the locked spec drives the backing schema.
2. **Unknown columns are dropped with a one-shot WARN.** Later batches
   carrying a new key (e.g. a hot-plugged device with an extra frame
   field) don't reshape the file/table silently — each new key logs
   once, then gets dropped on subsequent batches without re-logging.
3. **Missing columns are filled with ``None``.** Row projection
   guarantees every locked column appears in the output dict, so
   sinks can rely on a stable shape per row.

This module is sink-facing only. It has no public re-export.
