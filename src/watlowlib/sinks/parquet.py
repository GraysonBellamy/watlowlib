"""Parquet sink — :mod:`pyarrow`, schema locked, zstd by default.

:class:`ParquetSink` writes one row per :class:`Sample` into a single
Parquet file. pyarrow is an optional dependency behind
``watlowlib[parquet]``; the import is deferred to :meth:`open` so
instantiating the sink succeeds on bare-core installs and
:class:`~watlowlib.errors.WatlowSinkDependencyError` is raised only
when the user actually tries to open the file.

Best-practice defaults baked in:

- **zstd** compression. It matches or beats snappy on write/read
  speed with ~30% better ratios and is fully supported across
  pyarrow >= 2, Spark, DuckDB, Polars, and pandas >= 1.3. Snappy and
  gzip remain available for compatibility with readers that don't
  support zstd.
- **Dictionary encoding on** for string columns (pyarrow default;
  surfaced as a knob so callers that know their cardinality is high
  can disable).
- **One row group per :meth:`write_many`**. Aligns durability with
  batch cadence — a crash mid-run loses at most the current batch.
  Callers that want fewer, bigger row groups can pass
  ``row_group_size``.

Schema evolution mirrors the other tabular sinks: the column set is
locked on the first batch (via
:class:`~watlowlib.sinks._schema.SchemaLock`). Unknown columns that
appear in later batches are dropped with a one-shot WARN. Adding a
new column mid-file would require rewriting the whole file, so it is
deliberately not supported.

Durability caveat: Parquet files are not readable until the footer
is flushed on :meth:`close`. If the process is killed mid-run you
will get a file with no usable footer. The recommended shutdown path
is the recorder's structured exit, which always reaches the sink's
async-context-manager ``__aexit__`` and runs :meth:`close`.
